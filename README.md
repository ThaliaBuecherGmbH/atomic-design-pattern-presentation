<h2 align="center">Atomic Design Patterns</h2>

Presentation about the Atomic Design pattern built with [spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/).
For further information about controlling the presentation see documentation of Spectacle [here](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/docs/basic-concepts/).

## Getting Started

First, run the presentation locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
